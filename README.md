Prototype virtual showroom engine in three.js. Physi.js is used for avatar movement and collision detection. I have the collection of testing data downloadable at http://michael-bln.de/dk3-data.zip. Unfortunately I am not a 3d graphic so the scene is not so impressive. It works fine on desktop PC but it's quite slow on mobile devices. Feel free to download, play and even improve :)
